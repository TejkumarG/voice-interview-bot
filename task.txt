Greetings!

Congrats on being selected to interview with 100x!

In this job, we’re looking for an ideal applicant to become a part of our AI Agent Team. This is a fully remote job. We’re excited to get to know you better. Your interview will be conducted in 4 stages.

Stage 1: At-home Assessment
Stage 2: Behavioural Interview
Stage 3: Interview with Manager
Stage 4: Final Interview with the CEO

You’re now in Stage 1.

Using ChatGPT’s API (or any other free alternative), create a voice bot that can respond to the following questions as YOU would respond to them.

Here’s an example of questions, not an exhaustive list of questions that we will test your bot with.

What should we know about your life story in a few sentences?
What’s your #1 superpower?
What are the top 3 areas you’d like to grow in?
What misconception do your coworkers have about you?
How do you push your boundaries and limits?

Submission Guidelines:
Provide a URL of your submission 48 hours of this message. Your submission will be a web app where the chatbot is deployed.

Important:
Your submission must be universally user-friendly, even for non-technical users. Please ensure:
✅ A web app or an interactive demo that allows anyone to easily test your voicebot
✅ A setup that is simple and does not require coding knowledge or complex installations (without any manual entry of API key).

Send your assessment AND resume to bhumika@100x.inc with the subject line:
"GEN AI: GEN AI ROUND 1 ASSESSMENT (LINKEDIN)"

Good luck! We are looking forward to seeing your output.
